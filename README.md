- **Survived**: (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## ❓ Questions Solved
1. What factors influenced passenger survival?
2. Does gender or class affect survival rate?
3. How do family size and fare impact survival?

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Gender Impact**: Female passengers had a higher survival rate.
- **Class Influence**: 1st class passengers were more likely to survive.
- **Age Factor**: Children under 10 had better survival chances.

## 📌 Outcome
